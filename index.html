            <p>Hello, my name is Anthony Cera, I also go by
                the nickname Ace, it stands for Anthony Cera 
                Espinoza (mother's maiden name). I currently work
                as a chef as a means to pay for school. Before that
                I was in production for 5 years working as a coordinator 
                for about 3 years.</p> 
            <p>I chose to get out of production because 
                it was difficult finding steady work and when you did it 
                usually had a negative effect on your networking. So now 
                I am in the Coding Bootcamp to learn as much as I can about 
                development and get a better job!</p>
